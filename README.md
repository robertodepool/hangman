# Hangman - Project 
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

Phases of project detailed in milestones 
In Milestone 1
- We simply set up the Github, downloading the project to my local computer. 
In Milestone 2
- word_list was defined as a list of my 5 favourite fruits
- We use the random module, which is going to help the programme randomise words using random.choice on the word.list
- This was tested 
- guess was assigned as the variable to have the input for the game 
- A piece of code that checks whether the input is a single character was implemented. Using if-else statements
- The README code was updated (not very much at that stage)
- The code was pushed to Github for the first time since being cloned. 
- Conclusion - the code has some features that can be used for Hangman, however, it is pretty disorderly at this stage 
In Milestone 3
- A piece of code was written doing While True loop checking whether the guess is a single alphabetical character. isalpha method was used to see whether it is alphabetical
- A piece of code if-else created to check whether the guess is in the letter. 
- Using the hangman template the code started to take some shape by assigning functions to the code already written. Curating ask_for_input and check_guess functions
- Additions such as lower casing to the guess and adding the check_guess function to the ask_for_input argument was done
- Most of the Milestone 1, 2, 3 README was done at this stage
- The code was pushed to Github.
- Conclusion this part was quite challenging as all the code was being put together into the class at this point.  Having to write all the attributes, checking indentations, adding new features whilst trying to not affect the current ones proved challenging, the code still feels pretty incomplete and is not working fully as whole.
